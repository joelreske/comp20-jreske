# What is this purpose of this Git repository? (duh!)

The purpose of this git reposity is to be a place to put and showcase all of the hard work I put into the Comp20 projects this semester. 

# What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?

My favorite asignment was the Redline MTBA assignment simply becasue it taught me how to use the Google Maps API and Google APIs in general which are quite useful.

# How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?

I'd say the greatest moments of growth have come through the process of really finishing projects to their full extent. I get a lot of practice starting personal projects with lofty goals in mind, but the act of really finishing the process and scoping down until the goal is reasonable is a really fantastinc skill. 

# What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.

The most important thing I learned was simply getting outside of my comfort zone and using tools and frameworks that I had never touched before. One example is using React for our group project - I may never again build a large web app without it. Also I had never used a NoSQL database before which is such an oversight. This class exposed me to a new type of database which I way use for future projects. 

# Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?

I would like to get even better at React. Its such a powerful tool, but I feel as though I'm really only scratching the surface of what it can do. Also I feel that with a better grasp on React's principles I will be able to pick up Angular much more quickly and have that be yet another tool that I know.
